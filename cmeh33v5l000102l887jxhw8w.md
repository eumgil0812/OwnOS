## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Event-Based Concurrency

There are two main ways to implement concurrency: **thread-based** and **event-based**.

Threads are intuitive but come with overhead and synchronization problems (locks, deadlocks, etc.). Event-based concurrency, on the other hand, uses a single control flow called the **event loop** to handle all operations.

* **Blocking vs Non-blocking**
    
    * Blocking: CPU wastes cycles just waiting.
        
    * Non-blocking: CPU only reacts when an event occurs ‚Üí much more efficient.
        

‚úÖ Real-world examples: GUI frameworks (button clicks), network servers (client requests).

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ The Event Loop

The event loop is essentially **‚Äúa loop that waits for events and dispatches them‚Äù**.

```cpp
while (true) {
    Event e = wait_for_event();
    handle_event(e);
}
```

* **Advantages**
    
    * No need for many threads.
        
    * Efficient even on single-core systems.
        
* **Disadvantages**
    
    * If an event handler takes too long, the whole loop stalls.
        
    * Limited ability to exploit multiple cores.
        

So, event-based systems are lightweight and simple, but they don‚Äôt fully utilize multi-core performance.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Non-blocking Interfaces

The biggest threat to an event loop is **blocking I/O**.  
Example: if `read()` blocks until data arrives, the entire loop stops.

The solution: **non-blocking I/O**.

* If no data is available, return immediately (`-1`, `EWOULDBLOCK`).
    
* The loop continues processing other events.
    

‚ö†Ô∏è Problem: How do we know when data arrives? Polling repeatedly is wasteful ‚Üí ‚Äúbusy waiting.‚Äù

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Readiness Notifications

Operating systems provide **readiness notifications**.  
They tell you when a resource is ready (e.g., ‚Äúsocket X has data to read‚Äù).

Common interfaces:

* `select()`
    
* `poll()`
    
* `epoll()` (Linux)
    
* `kqueue()` (BSD systems)
    

This allows the event loop to only handle **ready events**, scaling to thousands of connections efficiently.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Event-Driven Architecture

On top of event loops, common **design patterns** emerge:

* **Reactor Pattern**
    
    * The app reacts when an event is *ready*.
        
    * Example: Nginx web server (epoll).
        
* **Proactor Pattern**
    
    * The OS completes the operation and then calls the handler.
        
    * Example: Windows IOCP.
        

üëâ Reactor = execute when ready.  
üëâ Proactor = execute when completed.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Summary

Key takeaways from event-based concurrency:

1. **Avoid blocking calls** at all costs.
    
2. **Non-blocking I/O + readiness notifications** are the backbone.
    
3. **Event handlers must be short and fast** to keep the loop responsive.
    
4. Best suited for large-scale network servers and GUIs.
    
5. Code complexity can be high ‚Üí abstraction libraries (Boost.Asio, libuv, Node.js) are helpful.
